## Project Description
The whole idea of this project is to help the end user ( the distributors, and the manufacturers) to verify the authenticity of the instruments they are going to buy by sacnning the qr code available on the intruments provided by the distributors. Starting for the manufacturer to the distributors, they are required to perform (transaction on the blockchain through algo wallet?) whenever the instruments are assigned to other distributors. This action will keep track the supply chain of the instruments and preserve the authenticity of the instruments.
